#  LOVE BASKET.

(A game about not dying)

Once upon a time a magical lady collected real live hearts (made of heart). It sounds vicious but she's sweet, I promise.

Also the door won't open unless she does. Which is the object of the game.

Unfortunately for her there are more doors behind each door, and unfortuantely for us there's just one damn door right now because I haven't yet coded advancing to the second level. But you get the idea.
